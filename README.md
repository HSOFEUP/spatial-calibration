# spatial-calibration
Python code to check the calibration of displays

This will involve displaying a bunch of images on your display, taking
pictures of them with a high-quality camera (turning all the bells and
whistles off, ideally storing as RAW images), and then running them
through the included analysis to determine the displayed contrast.
